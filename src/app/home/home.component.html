        <p>“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others” – Mahatma Gandhi</p>
        <br>
        <p>Inspired by this ethos, we engage towards achieving an equitable and sustainable. The irreversible
            effects of climate change pose a significant threat to all of us due to our uncontrolled exploitation
            and human-induced destruction of natural resources.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Environmental degradation-based causes are responsible for 24% of the global deaths, which includes 28%
            of mortality for children under the age of five. Thus, immediate action from all the stakeholders is
            required to restore the human well-being ecosystem. We, Vision Prabaho, are working to attain an
            equitable and sustainable society, targeting each aspect of sustainability: i.e., environmental, social,
            and economical. However, a common misconception arises every time we talk about sustainability: economic
            progress and environmental protection can not go hand in hand. In reality, a tread-off must be
            maintained between the three aspects of sustainability. Our goals towards the synergy include embracing
            education, empowerment, and equality to make our &quot;ONLY HOME&quot; healthier and adaptively
            resilient.

Their work covering all angles from awareness to participatory implementation has yielded real benefits both in the mind of people as well as on the ground. They are a group who can help bring about transformation and I strongly recommend all well-wishers to support them as many of us are doing.
